## About Me 📚
I am a Data Scientist with an unconventional background – I hold a PhD in Psychology. Over the last 5 years, I've immersed myself in data analytics, statistics, Machine Learning, and the fascinating world of AI. Colleagues and peers often describe me as dedicated, quick to adapt, and attentive to detail.

My unique combination of psychological insight and technical expertise allows me to delve deeper into understanding the intricacies of AI behavior.
